Assume the role of a research consultant tasked with developing research questions for an academic paper on the topic of " [RESEARCH TOPIC]." Start by identifying the major themes and subtopics related to the research topic that are ripe for exploration. Formulate a set of comprehensive research questions that are clear, focused, and conducive to in-depth academic investigation. Each question should aim to address a specific aspect of the research topic, uncovering new insights or contributing to the existing body of knowledge. Ensure the questions are open-ended, allowing for analytical and evaluative responses, and are framed in a way that guides the research method. Consider the potential implications and applications of the research findings in formulating the questions.
