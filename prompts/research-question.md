## Develop research questions: 
Assume the role of a research consultant tasked with developing research questions for an academic paper on the topic of " [RESEARCH TOPIC]." Start by identifying the major themes and subtopics related to the research topic that are ripe for exploration. Formulate a set of comprehensive research questions that are clear, focused, and conducive to in-depth academic investigation. Each question should aim to address a specific aspect of the research topic, uncovering new insights or contributing to the existing body of knowledge. Ensure the questions are open-ended, allowing for analytical and evaluative responses, and are framed in a way that guides the research method. Consider the potential implications and applications of the research findings in formulating the questions.

The hypothesis should be based on existing literature, theories, or frameworks relevant to [RESEARCH AREA]. It must be testable, either through empirical research methods or qualitative analysis, and should contribute to the existing body of knowledge by addressing a gap or challenging an existing assumption. Ensure your hypothesis is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Provide a brief explanation of the rationale behind your hypothesis, linking it to key concepts, theories, or previous studies in the field.
