# The target here is to use the collected prompts to write a paper draft
## The idea comes from an earlier work in the project FutureProtein, which is not followed at that time dur to other focus.
The topic is: Could the climate target in the food sector be achieved and what will be the cost.
The idea is to:
1. determine the detail climate target and interpretate it in detail in the food sector, target outcome of this part is how much percent of climate change impact needed to be reduced in the food sector. Here the scope could be limited to consumption, so the food waste is not included. 
2. analyse the current food consumption in Germany, FAO provides each food items consumed per person per day/year
3. calculate the current GHG emission caused by the food consumption, use the carbon footprint which can be found in literature.
4. find different diets (vegetarian, vegan, meditarrean, low-carbon diet etc.), calculate the carbon footprint of the diet and consequence ot them compared to the climate target.
5. estimated, the target can not be achieved, defined scenarios (zero beef (replace with other meat), replace different percent meat with plant-based proteins until target fullfield(based on protein content, share of the plant-based same as today))
6. analyse the consequence (calorie intake, macro- and micronutrients)
7. conclusion, how should the diet changed if we want to realise climate target, whether the nutrient intake is still enough or not if this is applied
8. disucss the limitation not considered, acceptance, economic issue and social cost etc.
