## 1. about prompts collection
  Tried to use openai api to collect and categorised the prompts from websites, could work if further refine the exclusion and categories criteria. Seems lots of requests and token needed to do this. 
  Collceting lots of prompts seems not so meaningful, need to test the prompts with example 

## 2. How to make a prompt library useful ?
  1. pre select the prompts.
  2. make more comprehensive prompts, like include persona, examples, output format.
  3. test with examples
     a. lots of examples ? (not easy to check the quality of output)
      
  
## 3. Other thoughts
  1. different LLMs models
  2. regulation of ai use in paper, most of journal restrict the use in improving the readability.
